    <h2 class = "title">Warriors</h2>
    <p>In a mythical fantasy world based off of South Asian culture and history, Warriors are just one of many different people, species, and societies. However, they are generally regarded as the most powerful, and are long-living mortals who possess the ability to wield the energy that flows through their seven chakras, both internally and externally. This allows them to enchance their abilities to such an extent that they have super strength, speed, sight, and hearing. This also gives them the ability to manipulate their surroundings with said energy.</p>
    <p>Their seventh chakra actualizes outside their body as a <b>rai</b> (stone) they wear on their body, which can be perceived as a weakness as it is more vulnerable. Their eyes and rai reflect the color of the energy that flows inside their body. They wield precisely the one weapon their ancestor (one of The Six) wielded to control/confine their power, mustered with their rai.</p>
    <p>This website is dedicated to exploring how these fantastical people came to be through the mythology that is their ancestors: the more well known and acknowledged Six who the Warriors honor to this day, and the forgotten supreme gods Surya and Soma who were lost to the tales of time.</p>

    <h2 class = "title">Origins of the Current Warriors</h2>
    <p>
        Hundreds of years later, The Six aren't around anymore and Surya is gone (disappeared after all of the OG six passed). 
        Normal humans grow to detest the powers that only warriors could hold, and insist more restrictions need to be placed on them.
        Although this doesn't work in the beginning because warriors are much stronger than others, 
        eventually the non-warriors gain access to unknown rais given by an unknown power that are able to drain the life force and energy running through their bodies, 
        rendering them defenseless as the warriors had no energy left to manipulate. They win against the warriors in a war called the <b><i>Hundred Years War</i></b> as the stones literally aged them by what seemed like 100 years.

        Agreeing to listen to the non-warriors, but not before they manage to destroy most of the stones that the non-warriors were given,
        a grudgeful truce is formed between the two bodies. The resulting treaty has the following conditions:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Warriors can only use the one weapon of their ancestor</li>
        <li>Warriors cannot marry other warriors (an already rare phenomenon due to rai defects)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There are more clauses in the middle, but these are the two more important ones that really show up in importance later on in this fantasy world.</p>

    <p>Public opinion on warriors became quite mixed after the Hundred Years War, an ego boost for the non-warriors.
        Warriors continued to help through working on missions, as mercenaries, and mostly physical work and tasks, being paid highly for these.
        However, they do so in more secrecy than before, and do not roam as freely, staying behind a forest of sleep raised by Surya long before, only stepping outside for missions and other various things. 
        Non-warriors only came when chosen (like jobs, marriage, etc.), else the forest would set them into sleep, where patrolling warriros would scoop them up and deliver them back to the outskirts.

    <h2 class = "title">Society</h2>
    <p>In warrior society, there is one council, with six council members, each one the oldest of their respective houses. Then there are the elites, which are the strongest warriors currently.
        There are six Elite Captains (ECs), each one of the strongest of their respective houses. Young warriors start training, schooling from the age of four, start easing into missions at the age of 11/12, and actually go into missions when they become 15.
    </p>

    <p>Warrior territory is usually made of half non-warriors and half warriors mostly due to marriage. Non-warriors become half-warriors after marriage, a fact hidden until it happens, imbued with enhanced prowess from half of the Rai they take from their spouse,
        but without the born power of being able to manipulate the energy flowing in their seven chakras, solely to protect themselves. Half-warriros have made it to warrior rank with enhanced prowess alone as well, some going on missions.

    <h2 class = "title">Now</h2>
    <p>After the Hundred Years War, the warriors actually became a "warrior" class again. Whereas The Six had been the strongest warriors to ever exist so far, with only some elite captains coming into the range much later,
        the war had set off a boom of high profile warriors. More powerful than ever before with how serious training had become, before there had been warriors who had never fought before. 
        But now, fighting was a necessity, and reaching max potential was the easiest way to protect oneself from surprises like the war.
    </p>

    <p>This leads to the present. Right now, the strongest warrior is <b>Esha</b>, the EC of the House of Sword (descendant of Eashwara from The Six), and all say she is as strong as The Six themselves, if not stronger. Her weapons are the dual swords,
        which she mastered from a young age. While most sword users are only able to muster up one sword or claymore or variation of sword with their rai, she is able to do two easily. Other ECs right now are Alaykya of the House of Knives,
        Simon of the House of Bow, Rykan of the House of Scythe/Spear, Myrta of the House of Staff, and Rana of the House of Gada.
