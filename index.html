    <h2>Warriors</h2>
    <p>Warriors exist, but what is their story?</p>
    <p>In a mythical fantasy world based off of South Asian culture and history, Warriors are just one of many different people, species, and societies. However, they are generally regarded as the most powerful, and are long-living mortals who possess the ability to wield the energy that flows through their seven chakras, both internally and externally. This allows them to enchance their abilities to such an extent that they have super strength, speed, sight, and hearing. This also gives them the ability to manipulate their surroundings with said energy.</p>
    <p>Their seventh chakra actualizes outside their body as a rai (stone) they wear on their body, which can be perceived as a weakness as it is more vulnerable. Their eyes and rai reflect the color of the energy that flows inside their body. They wield precisely the one weapon their ancestor (one of The Six) wielded to control/confine their power.</p>
    <p>This website is dedicated to exploring how these fantastical people came to be through the mythology that is their ancestors: the more well known and acknowledged Six who the Warriors honor to this day, and the forgotten supreme gods Surya and Soma who were lost to the tales of time.</p>
