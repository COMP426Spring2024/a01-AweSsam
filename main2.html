    <p>One of the two main gods in this fantastical warrior mythology, Soma is the God of Destruction, along with the god of moon, dark, ocean, and night. Together, Soma and Surya make a third god, the God of Preservation, time, etc. Although events where they have come together to culminate as the third god is rare, the warrior books heed to a time where this might be necessary.</p>
    <p>Reincarnated through thousands of lives, they finally take their final forms where they are immortalized.</p>

    <h2 class = "title">Origins & Legacy</h2>
    <p>Existing as primoridal beings from the beginning of time, Soma and Surya only developed their humanoid bodies along with the rest of the humanoid species.
        Other lesser deities, spirits, and yakshas came into existence through their influence, but not from their lineage, an example being the Hill Giant Vasuda who was ancestor to the Slavoka tribe.
        At the start of the era of the humanoids, for an unknown reason, their souls scatter into pieces across the world and 
        Surya and Soma reincarnate through thousands of lives, gaining knowledge, experience, and wisdom. 
        Although they do not remember their past lives in their life right away, eventually they reach a state of understanding in their life where they do indeed remember.
        Depending on their life and how they lived it, this understanding may come sooner or later, and with it comes their true prowess.

        The variety of the thousands of lives they have lived is immense, as they have both been the bad and the good, the rich and the poor, the pretty and the ugly, the powerful and the powerless.
        They lack their original powers until they remember, and even then they only gain the true extent of them once they finish collecting their soul completely and immortalize.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the end, they take upon their final immortalized forms forever, and Soma's final form is a man. Just as Surya and Soma are about to have kids, Soma disappears, and Surya cannot find him no matter how hard she looks.
        Eventually, the search grows futile and Surya has their kids, sextuplets who are born with enhanced abilities as mortal demigods.
        They are known as The Six, and they give birth to a line of warriors, descendants with the same abilities they have. 
        After all of the original Six pass, Surya also disappears into hiding. The warriors left behind are Soma's legacy, even if no one knows it.
    </p>

    <p>
        To this day, no one knows what happened to Soma.

    <h2 class = "title">Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        The sympathetic of the two supreme gods, Soma was known for his <b>strength, mercy, intelligence, and cool + relaxed demeanor</b>.
        Often chastised by Surya on his softness for his decisions in what to destroy and not destroy, when to show mercy and when to not,
        Soma was known for his merciful approach to destruction and preservation. Battling between destroying anything slightly harmful to anyone, and not destroying anything slightly helpful to anyone, Soma was also known as the less decisive of the two.
        Experiencing multiple lives to truly understand the lives he was protecting led him to understand what to destroy and preserve with Surya going forward.
        Soma also directly created facets of culture, tradition, and festivals through his extremely significant to extremely insignificant lives that she experienced collecting her soul.
    </p>

    <p>
        Soma often played a reclusive role in society, and stayed in the shadows letting other organisms and humanoids do the work of cleaning up themselves.
        He didn't feel a need to intervene and was known for his all-knowing perspective, as when he was reincarnating, he usually remembered his past lives and who he was faster than Surya.
        However, after reaching enlightenment and immortalizing, Soma played a more involved role in the universe, wanting to make up for his lack of destroying things that should have been destroyed that he experienced in many of his past lives.

    <p>
        Most knowledge of Soma's past lives have disappeared long into time with his final disappearance. Not much is known about Soma, and it is forgotten what he exactly looked like in his final form, and it is forgotten that he ever existed.
