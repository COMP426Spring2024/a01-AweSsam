    <p>One of the two main gods in this fantastical warrior mythology, Soma is the God of Destruction, along with the god of moon, dark, ocean, and night. Together, Soma and Surya make a third god, the God of Preservation, time, etc. Although events where they have come together to culminate as the third god is rare, the warrior books heed to a time where this might be necessary.</p>
    <p>Reincarnated through thousands of lives, they finally take their final forms where they are immortalized.</p>
