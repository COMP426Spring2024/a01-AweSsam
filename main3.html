<p>The children of Surya and Soma, The Six are the long-living mortal demigods possessing the ability to wield the energy that flows through their seven chakras, both internally and externally.</p>
<p>In order, they are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Raani</li> <!-- (Qualities of a) Queen -->
    <li>Agni</li> <!-- (Hell) Fire -->
    <li>Eashwara</li> <!-- (Gentle but unknown slate) -->
    <li>Sikandar</li>  <!-- (Loyal) Defender -->
    <li>Naitik</li> <!-- (Proud but) Ethical -->
    <li>Yodheya</li> <!-- (A) Fighter -->
</ol>

<p>This allows them to enchance their abilities to such an extent that they have super strength, speed, sight, and hearing. This also gives them the ability to manipulate their surroundings with said energy.</p>
<p>Unlike their parents, their seventh chakra actualizes outside their body as a rai (stone) they wear on their body, which can be perceived as a weakness as it is more vulnerable. This also attribute as the reason for their mortal lives.</p>
<p>Their eyes and rai reflect the color of the energy that flows inside their body. They wield precisely one weapon each to control/confine their power.</p>

<p>They give birth to a line of warriors, descendants with these same abilities and a wide range of uniquely identifying energies. They wield the one weapon their predecessor did.</p>
