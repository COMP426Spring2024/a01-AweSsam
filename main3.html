<p>The children of Surya and Soma, The Six are the long-living mortal demigods possessing the ability to wield the energy that flows through their seven chakras, both internally and externally.
    This allows them to enchance their abilities to such an extent that they have super strength, speed, sight, and hearing. This also gives them the ability to manipulate their surroundings with said energy.

    <p>In order, they are:</p>

        <li><b>Agni</b></li> <!-- (Hell) Fire -->
        <li><b>Eashwara</b></li> <!-- (Gentle but unknown slate) -->
        <li><b>Sikandar</b></li>  <!-- (Loyal) Defender -->

    <p>Unlike their parents, their seventh chakra actualizes outside their body as a <b>rai</b> (stone) they wear on their body, which can be perceived as a weakness as it is more vulnerable. This also attribute as the reason for their mortal lives.
        Their eyes and rai reflect the color of the energy that flows inside their body. They wield precisely one weapon each to control/confine their power.
        They give birth to a line of warriors, descendants with these same abilities and a wide range of uniquely identifying energies. They wield the one weapon their predecessor did. <br><br>

    <h2 class = "title">Origins & Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        Born to Surya and Soma, a fact unknown to most of the world, not much is remembered about The Six, except through what is preserved and kept in Warrior Territory to this day.
        However, they were known for their distinct appearances from each other, yet likeness, and their strength. 
        Seen as monsters for most of their lives, the world only realized their benevolent intentions after they had gotten much older and proved themselves through their deeds.
    </p>

    <p>They are most well known for their line of descendants: Warriors who inherited the same abilities they themselves had. 
        Their descendants were also unique in that their abilities didn't fade throughout generations, but each descendant had virtually the same potential The Six themselves had.
        Warrior blood seemed to dominate 100%.
