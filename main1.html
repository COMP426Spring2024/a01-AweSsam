    <p>One of the two main gods in this fantastical warrior mythology, Surya is the God of Creation, along with the god of sun, light, land, and day. Together, Surya and Soma make a third god, the God of Preservation, time, etc. Although events where they have come together to culminate as the third god is rare, the warrior books heed to a time where this might be necessary.</p>
    <p>Reincarnated through thousands of lives, they finally take their final forms where they are immortalized.</p>

        "The only way the creator and destroyer can preserve and choose what to preserve is to know and understand, and the only way to understand is to empathize."<br>
        And to empathize was to place yourself into others situations. What better way was there to do it rather than living out a life for yourself?

    <h2 class = "title">Origins</h2>
    <p>Existing as primoridal beings from the beginning of time, Surya and Soma only developed their humanoid bodies along with the rest of the humanoid species.
        Other lesser deities, spirits, and yakshas came into existence through their influence, but not from their lineage.
