    <p>One of the two main gods in this fantastical warrior mythology, Surya is the God of Creation, along with the god of sun, light, land, and day. Together, Surya and Soma make a third god, the God of Preservation, time, etc. Although events where they have come together to culminate as the third god is rare, the warrior books heed to a time where this might be necessary.</p>
    <p>Reincarnated through thousands of lives, they finally take their final forms where they are immortalized.</p>

        "The only way the creator and destroyer can preserve and choose what to preserve is to know and understand, and the only way to understand is to empathize."<br>
        And to empathize was to place yourself into others situations. What better way was there to do it rather than living out a life for yourself?

    <h2 class = "title">Origins & Legacy</h2>
    <p>Existing as primoridal beings from the beginning of time, Surya and Soma only developed their humanoid bodies along with the rest of the humanoid species.
        Other lesser deities, spirits, and yakshas came into existence through their influence, but not from their lineage, an example being the Hill Giant Vasuda who was ancestor to the Slavoka tribe.
        At the start of the era of the humanoids, for an unknown reason, their souls scatter into pieces across the world and 
        Surya and Soma reincarnate through thousands of lives, gaining knowledge, experience, and wisdom. 
        Although they do not remember their past lives in their life right away, eventually they reach a state of understanding in their life where they do indeed remember.
        Depending on their life and how they lived it, this understanding may come sooner or later, and with it comes their true prowess.

        The variety of the thousands of lives they have lived is immense, as they have both been the bad and the good, the rich and the poor, the pretty and the ugly, the powerful and the powerless.
        They lack their original powers until they remember, and even then they only gain the true extent of them once they finish collecting their soul completely and immortalize.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the end, they take upon their final immortalized forms forever, and Surya's final form is a woman. Just as Surya and Soma are about to have kids, Soma disappears, and Surya cannot find him no matter how hard she looks.
        Eventually, the search grows futile and Surya has their kids, sextuplets who are born with enhanced abilities as mortal demigods.
        They are known as The Six, and they give birth to a line of warriors, descendants with the same abilities they have. 
        After all of the original Six pass, Surya also disappears into hiding. The warriors left behind are Surya's legacy, even if no one knows it.

    <h2 class = "title">Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        The sterner of the two supreme gods, Surya was known for her <b>strength, calculation, intelligence, and decisiveness</b>.
        Often chastising Soma on his softness for his decisions in what to destroy and not destroy, when to show mercy and when to not,
        Surya had no qualms on making the more brutal decisions of influencing disease, famine, and wars to keep those who deserved it and the balance of life in check. 
        It's important to note that although Surya was the god of creation and played a role in creating the beginnings of life out of influence as her primordial self, multicellular organisms such as humanoids came from evolution through millions of years.
        Experiencing multiple lives to truly understand the life born through her indirect cause led her to understand what to create and preserve with Soma going forward.
        She directly created facets of culture, tradition, and festivals through her extremely significant to extremely insignificant lives that she experienced collecting her soul.
    </p>

    <p>
        After reaching enlightenment and immortalizing, Surya played a more detached role in the universe, wanting to live a life of their own violition.
        After's Soma's disappearance, she adopts some of his mannerisms in remembrance, and governs with his similar hand.
        She finally creates something after a long time: her six kids.
    </p>

    <p>They are embued with what she thinks are blessing qualities:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The abilities that set them apart and give them the power to make change.</li>
        <li>Long but mortal lives that let them appreciate and remove them from her similar pain of loneliness.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class = "title">Famous Avatars</h2>
    <p>
        Although not explicitly known as Surya's reincarnations, a famous avatar that was a well known figure in history was <b>Maharaja Yuvraj Mewar Singh</b>.
        Prince Yuvraj was prince of the Northern region and known for his bratty, childish personality from since he was young. 
        Although it takes shorter or longer for one of Surya's lives to remember who they are and their past lives, Prince Yuvraj's was one of the shortest--he remembered only at the age of 19. 
        Driven by loneliness from a diplomatic childhood with no friends and parents who had passed when he was young, he gradually forced himself to remember the only one he had left--Soma, and then himself.
        The shocking memories of everyone else he had lost in his past lives was almost too much to handle, but through his awakened understanding as Surya and the help of Soma's current reincarnation,
        he underwent a drastic metamorphosis that shook the country at the time. Becoming King Yuvraj, he eventually lead the nation through difficult times of war, before dying young at 32, shortly after the death of Soma's then reincarnation.
