    <p>One of the two main gods in this fantastical warrior mythology, Surya is the God of Creation, along with the god of sun, light, land, and day. Together, Surya and Soma make a third god, the God of Preservation, time, etc. Although events where they have come together to culminate as the third god is rare, the warrior books heed to a time where this might be necessary.</p>
